# BabySOC Fundamentals (Theory)


What is a System on Chip(SoC)?

An SoC is a single-die chip that has some different IP cores on it. These IPs could vary from microprocessors (completely digital) to 5G broadband modems (completely analog).

The design of a system on chip usually includes a central processing unit, memory, ports for input and outputs, secondary storage devices, and peripheral interfaces such as timers etc.

Depending upon the requirement it can also consists of a digital or analog signal processing system or a floating point unit fpu.

SoC with equivalent functionality will have increased performance and reduced power consumption as well as a smaller semiconductor die area.
